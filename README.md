# TimeBox

TimeBox is an iOS app currently in development designed to enhance time management skills for individuals who focus on time from a macro perspective.

- Existing time management applications are overly complicated and packed with features we often donâ€™t use, with the better apps usually requiring payment.
- This project is open-source and appreciates the insights of individual contributors.


In today's digital world, I believe that time management is a crucial skill, as it frequently causes people to bury their heads in their devices, leading to doomscrolling and mental fatigue.

- Procrastination
- Lack of achievement dopamine compared to a 30-second joke video.
